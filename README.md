# Simple ChatGPT-Like Web Chat

This project is a basic interactive web chat interface inspired by ChatGPT.  
Users can type messages and receive AI-generated responses (currently placeholder replies).

## Features

- Clean, simple chat UI with user and AI messages  
- Supports typing messages and pressing Enter or clicking Send  
- Easily extendable to connect with real AI backend services like OpenAI API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)  
- (Optional) Node.js or Python if you want to build and run a backend server  

### Running Locally

You can open `index.html` directly in your browser for a demo with placeholder AI replies.  
To preview with a local server (recommended):

1. If you have VS Code, install the **Live Server** extension.  
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.  
3. Right-click `index.html` and choose **Open with Live Server**.  
4. Chat away in the browser!

### Connecting a Backend

To integrate with a real AI backend:

- Set up a backend server (Node.js, Python, etc.) that handles AI requests.  
- Modify the frontend JavaScript to send messages to your backend endpoint and display real AI responses.

## Deployment

- The frontend is static and can be hosted on platforms like **GitHub Pages**.  
- Backend services require hosting on cloud platforms such as **Heroku**, **Vercel**, or others.

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests to improve the project.
